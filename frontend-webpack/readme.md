# Frontend build with Webpack and ES6

## Setup

### How initial setup was done
The initial setup is currently inspired by this [blog-post](http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-single-page-react-web-app-with-react-router-and-webpack/). It provides the simplest setup for using react with [ES6](linkme) build with [Webpack](linkme).

1.  `npm init` in base directory.
2.  `npm install --save-dev react webpack react-router react-hot-loader webpack-dev-server babel-loader` to install dependencies
3.  `mkdir js css && touch index.html webpack.config.js` create base files and folders for setup

## Run the Webpack

 - to build the project run `npm run build`
 - to start devserver do `npm start`

## GENERAL TODOS:
  - Less or SASS processing
  - JSX support
